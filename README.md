This is a work in progress. I wanted to gain more experience with rust, so I decided to write a parser for the alttpr.com spoiler logs for A Link to the Past Randomizer.

Currently, it's working just enough, has no tests, and is not beautiful code. That's what learning is about, I suppose. I will continue to add tests, documentation, and features in my spare time.
