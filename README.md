This is a work in progress. I wanted to gain more experience with rust, so I decided to write a parser for the alttpr.com spoiler logs for A Link to the Past Randomizer.

THIS IS NOT TO BE USED IN A RACE OR COMPETITIVE SETTING! 

Currently, it's working just enough, has no tests, and is not beautiful code. That's what learning is about, I suppose. I will continue to add tests, documentation, and features in my spare time.

Future plans:
              Format this readme :)
              Friendlier names for some things (could tie into the below)
              i18n or whatever works for translations?
              Support other modes (this currently only definitely works on the settings I chose, but should work for all v31 I think)
              Implement the shops struct if requested/required
              Attach to a pretty UI
              Attach to a web server and do more stuff (users, options, etc. maybe?)
              Create a mapper that shows all the locations on map (kinda like a tracker but with more info such as actual rewards)
              Add an option to try to generate routes based on different options, but that is a long way off.
